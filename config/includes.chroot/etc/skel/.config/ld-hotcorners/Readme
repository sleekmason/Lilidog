Welcome to ld-hotcorners!

Try all of the corners out. Simply drag your mouse to a corner.

Top-left       =  Wbar
Top-right      =  Toggles Compton
Lower-right    =  Exit menu
Lower-left     =  urxvt terminal

Once you get used to the bounceback, quite a handy little script.

You can change these items in ~/.config/ld-hotcorners/ld-hotcornersrc
There is a "Toggle" menu entry for ld-hotcorners under 'Configuration'.


In order to use ld-hotcorners as default on login, go to menu,
 configuration, LxSession autostart, and under autostart add:
 
ld-hotcorners --daemon
