   This is a stable kernel from www.kernel.org, with the
   Debugging mostly removed. Support for ntfs read and write,
   and more. See the readme for more info.
  
   This script installs git, build essential, and irqbalance,
   before cloning the sleek kernel into Downloads, extracting,
   and then installing. The kernel and headers are 50.3MB
   
   Be aware that the highest numbered kernel is automatically
   booted, and you may need to go to 'advanced options' on
   boot if you have installed a higher numbered kernel 
   previously.
   
   If this kernel or any others do not work for you, reboot 
   and choose your old kernel in the Advanced Options screen,
   then use apt or the kernel remover from the menu to 
   remove the kernel and headers.

   Please press enter to install the kernel packages.
