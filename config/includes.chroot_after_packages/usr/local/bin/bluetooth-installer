read -p "   Bluetooth Installer - Bluetooth may not work while in a VM.


   This script will install the packages necessary for bluetooth use in 
   Lilidog. Bluetooth may, or may not work depending on your computer.
   
   Here is the script install list: bluetooth bluez-tools blueman rfkill
   pulseaudio-module-bluetooth
   
   After installation, you should be able to connect through the options
   in the bluetooth tasktray applet. I used the directions from here:
   https://sourceforge.net/p/lilidog/discussion/setup/thread/6b7ce1898e/
   in order to connect to my android smart phone.
   
   Once installed, you will need to log out and back in to initialize
   the bluetooth-manager applet which should appear in the task tray.
   
   ----------------------------------------
   
   Please press enter to install bluetooth.
   
   ----------------------------------------
      
   Or close this terminal window to quit the install." ;
