   See: https://liquorix.net/ for more info. Great for gaming.

   Be aware that the highest numbered kernel is automatically
   booted, and you may need to go to 'advanced options' on
   boot if you previously installed a higher numbered kernel.
   
   If this kernel or any others do not work for you, reboot 
   and choose your old kernel in the Advanced Options screen,
   then after boot, use apt or the kernel remover from the
   menu to remove the offending kernel and headers.

   This script will install the Liquorix kernel and headers
   and other related packaged. 
     
   --------------------------------------------------
   
   Please press enter to install the kernel packages.
