##DIRECTIONS

If you choose to change over to using the openbox menu, 
you can simply backup the existing rc.xml, and then change 
the name of rc.xml-original to rc.xml.

Please note the the Openbox menu is the original full menu, 
and will need to be adjusted as such.  This will have to be done
by editing the file, as no menu editor exists anymore.
