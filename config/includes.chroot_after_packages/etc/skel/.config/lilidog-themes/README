These are the individual Lilidog theme scripts that set the different 
options for each color theme in the Quick Theme Changer.

The current setting will change: GTK theme, Openbox theme, Geany theme,
Xfce4-terminal theme, and Jgmenu theme.

Changing any of the options is easy so long as the theme is recognized
by the system settings. Simply change the name of the theme in the file 
of your choosing. 

Maybe you want a Lilidog-dark terminal with the lilidog-bright theme? 
No problem! Maybe some other theme entirely? Your choice.

Other options not listed in the themes can be set as well.  Maybe you
want conky or your wallpaper set with the theme?

Also, if you would like to add a button to the theme changer itself, 
rather than change one of the existing themes? Sure! The script 
'ld-theme-changer' is located in /usr/local/bin.

If you don't want to work from root, make a folder: ~/bin and copy
ld-theme-changer from /usr/local/bin.  Logout, and back in for ~/bin to 
be placed in your path. The script in ~/bin will be the active script.

Just copy and paste a new line and then change the values.  Easy peasy.

The options are endless, and you can create exactly what you want!
