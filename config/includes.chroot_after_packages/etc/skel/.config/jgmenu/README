### TO CHANGE MENU ITEMS
Open mymenu.csv file to add or remove items.  
The format example is: Display-name, program-name, icon-name
See the lxterminal entry for an example.
For the original automated menu, open ~/.config/jgmenu/jgmenurc
and comment (#) line 5. 


###TO CHANGE THEMES EASILY
Use the command: 'jgmenu-interactive' in a terminal for the 
jgmenu interactive menu. (various choices to be made).
Use  "o" or "g" to change to the openbox theme or the gtk theme 
colors after changing gtk themes.

Changing other items here could have a detrimental affect on your menu.
However, why not have a little fun and learn something;)
There are backups to all the original files in ~/.config/jgmenu.bak 
if a mistake is made.

### TO CHANGE ICONS
Open ~/.config/jgmenu/jgmenurc -> icon_theme (line 54)


###*NOTE
"jgmenu-interactive" uses urxvt to open the complete line of:
'jgmenu_run init --interactive -i' in case you do away with urxvt.
If you have better ideas, tell me.
'man jgmenu' in a terminal for more info!
