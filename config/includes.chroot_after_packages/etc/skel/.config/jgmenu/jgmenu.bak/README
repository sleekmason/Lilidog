### TO CHANGE MENU ITEMS
There is currently no gui menu editor for jgmenu. So:
Open the mymenu.csv file to add/remove items in the menu.  
The format example is: Display-name, program-name, icon-name
See the other entries for examples.

All newly installed programs are still available through the 
"Debian" menu if you don't want to edit. 


###TO CHANGE THEMES EASILY
Go to 'jgmenu Theme Changer' in the Configuration menu to open  
the jgmenu interactive menu. Would stick to changing the theme to
the current theme unless experimenting. 

Use  "o" or "g" to change to the openbox theme or the gtk theme 
colors after changing gtk themes.


### TO CHANGE ICONS
Open ~/.config/jgmenu/jgmenurc -> icon_theme (line 54)


###*NOTE
If you would like to use the jgmenu standard menu, comment line 5 of 
~/.config/jgmenu/jgmenurc. Then rename prepend.csv.bak & append.csv.bak 
to prepend.csv & append.csv.

'man jgmenu' in a terminal for more info!
